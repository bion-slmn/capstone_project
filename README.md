# üö≤ Electric Bike Booking Platform

## üîñ Project Title & Description
**Title:** Electric Bike Booking Platform

**Description:**
A web application that enables clients to book electric bike rides and riders to manage ride assignments. The platform streamlines urban mobility by connecting users with available electric bikes and riders, making eco-friendly transportation accessible and convenient. Target users include city commuters, tourists, and delivery riders. The project aims to reduce traffic congestion, promote sustainability, and offer a seamless booking experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript)
- **Backend:** NestJS (TypeScript)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or MongoDB)
- **Authentication:** JWT, OAuth (optional)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Material UI
- **APIs:** RESTful (with possible GraphQL extension)
- **Dev Tools:** VS Code, Git, Docker (optional)

## üß† AI Integration Strategy
### Code Generation
- Use GitHub Copilot and CLI agents to scaffold components, services, controllers, and models for both frontend and backend.
- Generate boilerplate code for authentication, booking logic, and API endpoints.
- Automate repetitive tasks (CRUD operations, form validation) using AI-powered code suggestions.

### Testing
- Employ AI tools to generate unit and integration tests for React components and NestJS modules.
- Use prompts to create test cases for booking flows, authentication, and edge cases.
- Leverage AI to refactor and optimize test coverage as features evolve.

### Documentation
- Generate docstrings and inline comments for all major functions and classes using AI.
- Maintain up-to-date README and API documentation with AI-assisted summaries and changelogs.
- Use AI to review and improve clarity, consistency, and completeness of documentation.

### Context-Aware Techniques
- Feed API specifications, file trees, and code diffs into AI workflows to generate context-relevant code, tests, and documentation.
- Use semantic search and context-aware prompts to quickly locate, refactor, or extend features based on project structure.
- Integrate AI-driven code review to catch bugs, suggest improvements, and ensure best practices.
